# NESTrisChamps

NESTrisChamps is a browser-based game capture and rendering system for NES classic Tetris.

It is available online under the domain [`nestrischamps.io`](https://nestrischamps.herokuapp.com)

NESTrisChamps is composed of 3 main parts:
* A browser based capture system
	* Supports both capture devices and screen capture
	* Supports 2 roms: Classic Tetris, and [Das Trainer](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3761/)
* A server to which captured game data is sent, and which rebroadcasts data
* A system of renderers to redraw game play from scratch
	* Crisp, pixel-perfect rendering
	* Many stats computed in real time
		* For reviewing one's own game footage after the fact
		* For audience to understand more about the game in real time
		* For match commentators to make better commentary in real time


Basically, when we have Tetris game data (as opposed to images), the tetris game can be re-rendered with custom layouts, and various statistics can be computed. When multiple player data are used, a competition UI can be built with score differential and other comparative stats.

NEsTrisChamps provides many rendering layouts implemented in HTML+CSS+JavaScript at 720p resolution. This allows the templates to be dropped easily in [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) or [StreamLabs OBS](https://streamlabs.com/) as a [Browser Sources](https://obsproject.com/wiki/Sources-Guide#browsersource), and then adding player video stream or other sources like Twitch Chat on top of it.

Documentation for sections of that UI is [here](https://github.com/timotheeg/NESTrisStatsUI/blob/master/docs/stats.md)

1 game demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhNsuIUrRD0)


### CTJC Competition Layout

![Full UI](./public/views/mp/ctjc_pace.jpg)

Includes score differentials, difference in number of tetrises, tetris rate computation, running tetris rate, and pace.

UI "inspired" from, and improving on, [CTJC's layout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATpW6TQ_H2c).

### Invisible Tetris Renderer

![Full UI](./public/views/1p/invisible_tetris.jpg)

Here's a demo of my playing from the renderer itself (it's harder than it looks because rendering runs 2 frame behind)
* [Game 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh2bqVe4wOo)
* [Game 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CLdBgV3DW4)

The 2 semi finals and the final match of CTWC 2019's Invisible Tetris Competition have also been rendered with this renderer for demo, as seen from the links below:
* [Semi 1 - Joseph vs Kauser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXluTMkbGG4)
* [Semi 2 - GreenTea vs Alex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVHS3EaVAA4)
* [Final - Kauser vs Alex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nBTSb1zKjc)



## Getting started

NESTrisChamps is only tested in Chrome, Chromium, and Firefox. It is unlikely I will support MS Edge unless someone contribute PRs.

Read [the documentation](https://nestrischamps.io/docs).


### NEStrisChamps online

1. In a window load your producer page [https://nestrischamps.io/room/producer](https://nestrischamps.herokuapp.com/room/producer)
2. Calibrate your input. If you're lucky the autocalibration would have done a good job, and only needs minor fine tuning. You still **must** fine tune to have the capture areas pixel-perfect (refer to [the OCR section](https://nestrischamps.io/docs/#ocr) for details) of the documentation.
3. Visit your personal renderers page to copy the renderer URL [https://nestrischamps.io/renderers](https://nestrischamps.herokuapp.com/renderers). I recommend using the layout `simple_1p` for a start
4. Start playing. The renderer should render your game.

Note: Both pages **must** be in their own windows. The producer cannot be a in background tab, or chrome would throttle its processing, and your capture would be all choppy.

Read this additional [calibration guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W7g536D6hWxRWWMO667dOY1fOm5HaO3XxskNSq7MA-k/edit) created by [aGameScout](https://www.twitch.tv/agamescout).



### OBS

Once you have connected your producer and renderer, you are ready to set up OBS or Streamlabs to stream it.

To do that, drop a Browser Source in OBS and use the renderer URL as-is. Make sure the Browser Source dimensions are set to 1280x720.

Also, verify that Browser Source hardware acceleration is set (under Advanced Settings).

### Local Setup

Warning: Local setup is for developpers and contributors. If you are a casual user, use [nestrischamps online](https://nestrischamps.io/) instead :)

[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)


#### Install nodejs

Nestrischamps is a [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) server application and UI. It can run on node 12 and above, but use 14+ if you can. Installation instruction for your OS are left for you to figure out.


#### Clone the project locally from git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/timotheeg/nestrischamps.git
```

#### Install nodejs dependencies

```bash
cd nestrischamps
npm install
```

#### Set up a postgres local DB

Install a local [Postgres DB](https://www.postgresql.org/) (instruction on how to do that is left to you. Check documentation for your OS), and set it up by running the [sql setup commands](./setup/db.sql).

#### Set up your environment variables

Create a file `.env` at the root of the project checkout folder. The following environment variables are required:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://<UNAME>:<PWD>@<HOST>:<PORT>/<DBNAME>
FF_SAVE_GAME_FRAMES=1
```

The variable `DATABASE_URL` should basically contains a [connection URI](https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting#connection-uri), which should match your DB access.

The variable `FF_SAVE_GAME_FRAMES=1` ensures that game files will saved locally (in the folder `games`. For replay if you want, of for further game analysis later if you are so enclined. If you do not want to save grame frames, remove the variable `FF_SAVE_GAME_FRAMES`

#### Install prettier

Prettier is installed when you install nodejs dependencies. To use prettier to format your code, please follow this [guide](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) to setup prettier with your code editor.

#### Run the server

Sets environment variable and start the server
```bash
npm run start-linux
```

#### Access the App

The app is accessed locally just like the online live version of nestrischamps.

The only thing the local versiopn des not support is Twitch login.

So, load the producer URL: [http://localhost:5000/room/producer](http://localhost:5000/room/producer), and click on the button `Login as Player 1` to set your session.

Next, lLoad the renderer URL: [http://localhost:5000/renderes](http://localhost:5000/renderers), and copy the URL for the layout you want.

Create a Browser source in OBS from that URL (again, just like in nestrischamps online mode).

You're done! From here on, everything should be connected and working!


#### Invite remote friends

If you know how to set up apps on your router (i.e. [port forwarding](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/), you can invite your friends to play on your local server. Make them access the producer URL, and ask them to login as player 2 rather than player 1.


## "Hidden" options

### Start Timer button

If you use the Stencil renderer to qualify for CTM or other online competitions, to start the timer, load your producer URL with an extra Query String argument like this [https://nestrischamps.io/room/producer?timer=1](https://nestrischamps.herokuapp.com/room/producer?timer=1)

![Screenshot of Start Timer Button](./public/docs/start_timer.jpg)

### Don't draw background

Many of the layouts have a black background with drak Yelow pieces drawn on them. If you'd rather have a transparent background, use the query string argument `?bg=0` to disable the background

### Don't use Half Height

Capture devices are presumed to produce interlaced output, which can create incorrect reads. NESTrisChamps by default uses only one line in 2 to remove interlacing deffect. Some capture device have built-in deinterlacer and smoothener which render a slightly blurry output. While this looks great, it's not well suited for the half-height system of NESTrisChamps.

It is possible to disable the half-height behaviour by adding the following query string argument in the producer page `?disable_half_height=1`.

### Enable Frame Buffering

By default, nestrischamps broadcasts frames immediately and renders them as soon as they are received. If network is good and latency is more or less consistent, rendering will look good while being the most real time possible. If latency is not consistent however, this can create a stuttering rendering effect, which may not look very good.

It is possible to enable frame buffering in many of the renderers by adding a query string argument `?buffer_time=X` , where X is the number in milliseconds of buffering one wishes to have. For a simple try out, use `?buffer_time=1000`.

When Frame buffering is active, frames are not rendered as soon as they are received. Instead, there is an initial delay to accumulate frames (in the example above, a 1s delay), and frames are then replayed with the timing interval they were captured at.

Note that, when you share your webcam feed at the same, it means your reaction on webcam will preceed the frames themselves. That may look slightly odd, but it is not a usualy a deal breaker.

### Enable Native webcam capture

So far "native" webcam support (e.g. built-in [webRTC](https://webrtc.org/)) is only built into some of the layouts, so by choosing the layouts, you chose whether there'll be webcam support or not. At the moment, the layouts which support webcam natively are `ctm_video`, `ctm_video2`, `ctm_2matches`, `stencil_ctwc_sing_21`.

Native webcam sharing can also be activated in the layouts `classic` and `das_trainer` with the query string argument `?video=1`.

### Enable Twitch Chat Text To Speech

In the producer window, if you add the query string `?tts=1` you can enable Twitch Chat TTS.

Chatters get assigned a random voice out of the available ones, with no repeats until all voices are exhausted, and then repeat may happen randomly.

Note that you can specify which language you want the voices to be in by adding an additional query string parameter `lang=X`, where `X` is a ISO 2-letter language code, e.g. `lang=en`. Defaults to `en` if not supplied.


## Contribute

To contribute, make sure you first set project to run locally (see previous sections), such you can test your code before opening up PRs.

Many issues and ideas for improvements are listed in the [github issues](https://github.com/timotheeg/nestrischamps/issues).

The code is sort of messy, and yet, I have some standards hidden in this mess. Until I document them, please ask on [the discord server](https://discord.gg/gaCEe5aX) before submitting PRs.
