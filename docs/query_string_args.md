# Query String Arguments in NesTrisChamps

## Context

NesTrischamps is a web application and uses standard [query string arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) to give some control to users. For example some arguments allow renderers to change background, or disable tetris sound.

When loading a url, query string arguments are key/value pairs, separated by the character `&`, like this: `name=yobi&state=online`.

The query string as a whole is appended to the page url after the character `?` for example: `https://nestrischamps.io/view/ctwc23/SECRET?name=yobi&state=online`.


## Capture page arguments

The capture page (a.k.a. producer page) supports some query string arguments as follows:

| Argument  | Possible values | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `disable_half_height`  | `0`: Deinterlace the input by halving the capture size before processing<br>`1`: DON'T deinterlace the input by halving the capture size before processing | `0` | Changing this value will change the capture size and thus breaks the calibration. You need to calibrate from scratch. |
| `tts`  | `0`: DON'T speak Twitch chat message<br>`1`: Use browser's [Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) to speak Twitch chat messages | `0` | |
| `webcam_audio` | `0`: DON'T send audio stream with player webcam feed<br>`1`: Send audio input with player webcam feed| `0` | |


## Global view arguments

Caveat: global args apply to **MOST** layouts, but some layouts may not understand the values

| Argument  | Possible values | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bg`  | `0`: Transparent background<br>`1`: Gold Tetris blocks on a black background<br>`2`: green NTC name moving accross the screen<br>`3`: Rainbow NTC name moving the screen<br>`4`: Wavy green NTC name moving across the screen <br>`5`: NTC trophies (not working well)| `1` | In OBS, prefer to set `bg=0` to save on resources on the browser source. |
| `tetris_sound` | `0`: DON'T play tetris sounds<br>`1`: Play tetris sounds| `1` | Some Layout defaults to `0` instead, use `1` explicitly to activate (e.g. `jdish` layout) |
| `tetris_flash` | `0`: NO Flash<br>`1`: Classic flash<br>`2`: Fade Flash<br>`3`: Swipe Flash<br>`4`: Explode Flash | `2` | Classic Flash may cause discomfort for viewers with light sensitivity |
| `avatar` | `0`: NO avatar underneath the playfield<br>`1`: Show avatars underneath the playfield | `1` | Avatar images are taken from Twitch<br>Avatar images can be overridden to custom images in the admin page |
| `video` | `0`: DON'T display player video<br>`1`: Play player video | `1` | Even if video is not set to zero, video only show if users agree to share their video in their producer page |
| `buffer_time` | An integer value representing the number of milliseconds for frames to be buffered before they are rendered. E.g. `500` | `0` (i.e. buffer is not used) | A buffer can be useful if the network is not very stable and rendering is choppy. Note that putting in a large value for `buffer_time` can cause the gameplay to be perceivably delayed compared to the player video feed, and look "weird" (player reacts before the thing they were doing happens!). |
| `combot` | `0`: No commentary bot<br>`1`: Activate commentary bot | `0` | Commentary bot uses the browser [Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) to give score updates for the first match in an NTC room (between player 1 and 2)|
| `lang` | `en`: Commentary bot in English<br>`fr`: Commentary bot in French | `en` | This argument controls the `combot` (see above)|
| `srabbit` | `0`: DON'T show Stack Rabbit placement recommendations<br>`1`: Show Stack Rabbit placement recommendations | `0` | |
| `srabbit_input_speed` | `2`<br>`6`<br>`7`<br>`8`<br>`10`<br>`11`<br>`12`<br>`13`<br>`13_5`<br>`14`<br>`15`<br>`18`<br>`20`<br>`24`<br>`30` | `12` | This controls the tapping speed in Hz Stack Rabbit assumes to give recommendations.|
| `srabbit_playout_length` | `0`: Stack Rabbit checks NO piece beyond current and preview <br>`1`: Stack Rabbit checks 1 piece beyond current and preview<br>`2`: Stack Rabbit checks 2 pieces beyond current and preview<br>`3`: Stack Rabbit checks 3 pieces beyond current and preview | `2` | This lets StackRabbit play out more possible combinations of future pieces into the board to give its recommendation. The higher the number the number the slower it gets.|

## Finding query string arguments

NestrisChamps is open source, so query string arguments can be found in code. Use the one liner below at the root of the codebase to find all flags by file:
```bash
git grep -E -i -o "QueryString\.get\('[^']+'\)" | sed -E -e "s/^(.+):.+'([^']+)'.+\$/\1:\2/" | sort | uniq
```
And then check the source files to see what the flag actually do.
