		<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

		<p>NEStrisChamp works with the concepts of room. Each user has 2 rooms:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A single-player Private room - to capture your own gameplay.</li>
			<li>
				A multi-player Match room - to organise and comment on other player
				matches.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The key is for players to OCR their game frames into the correct room.
		</p>

		<p>
			For single player rooms, you just need to send your game frames into the
			room and into the view for them to be rendered.
		</p>

		<p>
			For Math room, you may invite as many people as you want to be producers,
			and you'll select who out of the room members gets to be player 1 and
			player 2.
		</p>

		<h1 id="architecture">Architecture and Terminology</h1>

		<p>
			In single player mode, frame data is passed straight from the producer
			into 1 or more views.
		</p>

		<p>
			<img alt="Architecture for 1 player" src="./architecture_1_player.png" />
		</p>

		<p>
			In competition mode, all producers emit data, but The room owner assigns a
			given producer to be player 1 and anotherproducer to be player 2. Only the
			game frame of these 2 players are sent to the views.
		</p>

		<p>
			<img
				alt="Architecture for 2 players"
				src="./architecture_2_players.png"
			/>
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Room: A broker of connection, frame data, and commands</li>
			<li>
				Producer: an entity doing 1) OCR and 2) emitting frames into the room
			</li>
			<li>
				View: Receives the frame data and redraw the scene, can accept other
				commands (e.g. to set player names)
			</li>
			<li>
				Admin UI: For Multi player rooms, the admin room allow the room owner to
				control which producer are player 1 and player 2, Update the player
				names, and assign victories.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h1 id="urls">URL scheme</h1>

		<h2 id="urls-views">Views</h2>

		<p>
			Since views are typically setup in OBS, the URL needs to identify the room
			owner by itself, This is achieved by assigning a secret to each user that
			can placed in the URL. It's not super secure, but whatever, this tool is
			not hosting state secrets -_-
		</p>

		<p>
			http://nestrischamps.io/view/<strong>LAYOUT_NAME</strong>/<strong
				>USER_SECRET</strong
			>
		</p>

		<p>The layouts available so far are as follow:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Single Player
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>classic</strong>: a stats-heay interface for classic rom
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>das_trainer</strong>: a stats-heay interface for the DAS
						trainer rom
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>simple_1p</strong>: a simple UI with Tetris rates and
						Droughts
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>invisible_tetris</strong>: A renderer for Invisible Tetris
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>qualifier</strong>: Minimalistics stats to add to your
						Stencil
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Multi Player
				<ul>
					<li><strong>ctwc</strong>: A CTWC inspired layout</li>
					<li><strong>ctjc</strong>: a CTJC inspired layout</li>
					<li>
						<strong>ctjc_pace</strong>: a CTJC inspired layout with pace metric
					</li>
					<li><strong>ctm</strong>: a CTM inspired layout</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			At your first login, a secret would have been generated for you and added
			to your user record. You can see it in your personal renderer links which
			are available
			<a href="https://nestrischamps.io/renderers">here</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Hopefully in the future, users will be able to contribute their own
			template.
		</p>

		<p>
			Several of the layouts have a black background with Tetris pieces. If you
			do not like it and would prefer a transparent background to place the
			layout above it, add the query string `?bg=0` into the view URL. Like
			so:<br />

		<h2 id="urls-producer">Producer</h2>

		<p>
			To produce frames into your own private room, visit
			<a href="https://nestrischamps.io/room/producer"
				>https://nestrischamps.io/room/producer</a
			>
		</p>

		<p>
			To attach yourself as a producer to another user's room (typically the
			link will be passed to you as an invitation), the links will be of the
			form
		</p>

		<p>

		</p>

		<h1 id="ocr">OCR and Calibration</h1>

		<p>
			OCR is supported in browser for both device capture and screen capture.
		</p>

		<p>2 default game roms are supported:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Classic Tetris</p>
				<img alt="Capture for Classic Tetris ROM" src="./capture_classic.png" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><a href="https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3761/">Das Trainer</a></p>
				<img
					alt="Capture for Das Trainer Tetris ROM"
					src="./capture_das_trainer.png"
				/>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The fields that need to be OCR-ed per rom are fixed (see highlighted areas
			above)
		</p>

		<p>
			There is a built-in automatic calibrator but it doesn't work to well, so
			you should always ajust the areas selected for calibration to be as close
			as possible to the desired outcome.
		</p>

		<p>
			In both cases, start a game at level 0 BEFORE you press the "Calibrate and
			Capture button". In Das trainer, pause as soon as the game starts click
			the button. In Classic Tetris, click as soon as the game starts. In both
			cases, keep your fingers crossed that the auto calibrator takes you close
			to the desired state, and then fine tune all the capture areas to be pixel
			perfect.
		</p>

		<p>
			Once calibration and tuning has been done, the capture window and the
			browser tab MUST stay focused.
		</p>

		<h2 id="ocr-digits">Digits</h2>

		<p>
			The capture area should "hug" the digits on top, right, bottom, left,
			(using 0 as a reference), like this:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><img alt="Capture area for 2 digits" src="./digits_2_0.png" /></li>
			<li><img alt="Capture area for 6 digits" src="./digits_6_0.png" /></li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Note that if you calibrate something that starts with a 1, the capture
			area should NOT hug the one on the left (notice the black strip on the
			left).
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><img alt="Capture area for 18" src="./digits_18.png" /></li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="ocr-preview">Preview</h2>

		<p>
			To calibrate the preview properly, run the calibration in level 0 over
			multiple pieces, such that:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					Pieces S, Z, L, J, T, O are "hugged" TOP and BOTTOM in the capture
					area
				</p>
				<img alt="Capture area for S preview" src="./preview_s.png" />
				<img alt="Capture area for Z preview" src="./preview_z.png" />
				<img alt="Capture area for L preview" src="./preview_l.png" />
				<img alt="Capture area for J preview" src="./preview_j.png" />
				<img alt="Capture area for T preview" src="./preview_t.png" />
				<img alt="Capture area for O preview" src="./preview_o.png" />
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>Piece I is "hugged" LEFT and RIGHT in the capture area</p>
				<img alt="Capture area for I preview" src="./preview_i.png" />
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>"hugged" means there is no black border</p>

		<h2 id="ocr-current-piece">Current Piece (DAS Trainer only)</h2>

		<p>
			To calibrate the preview properly, run the calibration in level 0 over
			multiple pieces, such that:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					Pieces L, J are "hugged" TOP ONLY in the capture area (notice there's
					a black strip at the bottom)
				</p>
				<img alt="Capture area for L current piece" src="./cur_piece_l.png" />
				<img alt="Capture area for J current piece" src="./cur_piece_j.png" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Pieces S, Z, T, O are "hugged" BOTTOM ONLY in the capture area (notice
					there's a black strip on top)
				</p>
				<img alt="Capture area for S current piece" src="./cur_piece_s.png" />
				<img alt="Capture area for Z current piece" src="./cur_piece_z.png" />
				<img alt="Capture area for T current piece" src="./cur_piece_t.png" />
				<img alt="Capture area for O current piece" src="./cur_piece_o.png" />
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>Piece I is "hugged" LEFT and RIGHT in the capture area</p>
				<img alt="Capture area for I current piece" src="./cur_piece_i.png" />
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="ocr-colors">Colors (Classic Tetris only)</h2>

		<p>
			Reading colors from the frame helps matching the block colors when
			scanning the field.
		</p>

		<p>
			The are 3 colors to read: color1, color2, and color3. They should be read
			from the pieces stats on the left by selecting one block from the T piece,
			J piece, and Z piece.
		</p>

		<p>The blocks should be chosen like this</p>

		<p>
			<img
				alt="Piece statistics panel highlighting color blocks"
				src="./statistics_colors.png"
			/>
		</p>

		<p>
			The selection should not include any black border, but color1 should
			include the block's border. They should look like this
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><img alt="Capture area for color 1" src="./color_1.png" /></li>
			<li><img alt="Capture area for color 2" src="./color_2.png" /></li>
			<li><img alt="Capture area for color 3" src="./color_3.png" /></li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="ocr-field">Field</h2>

		<p>
			To calibrate the field capture, try to stack pieces on the left, right,
			and bottom, and even all the way up on the top-left and top-right.
		</p>

		<p>
			Having done that, hug the capture on right, left, top, bottom. do not
			leave black borders at the bottom and right!, like this:
		</p>

		<p><img alt="Capture area for field" src="./field.png" /></p>

		<h1 id="obs">OBS / Streamlabs setup</h1>

		<p>
			All layouts so far are 720p (1280x720), which is a good compromise of real
			estate vs. draw time and upload bandwidth requirements. But feel free to
			stretch the layout to fit a 1080p canva
		</p>

		<p>The Browser Source setup should look like this:</p>

		<p>
			<img
				alt="OBS browser source configuration panel"
				src="./streamlabs_browser_source.png"
			/>
		</p>

		<h1 id="admin">Administering a Room</h1>

		<p><img alt="Admin UI" src="./admin_ui.png" /></p>

		<p>
			In the admin panel, you get to see who is connected to the room, and
			select the desired producers as player 1 and player 2
		</p>

		<p>
			The Name and Avatar are taken from Twitch data, but can be updated to
			suit.
		</p>

		<p>The number of match to get to victory can change ("Best of" dropdown)</p>

		<p>
			Each player has a heart control, the heart can be clicked to attribute
			victories.
		</p>

		<p>
			The "Winner" button displays a little animation in the field to show the
			winner and loser of the match. Do NOT click it until both players have
			topped out! If the winning player is chasing a maxout or what not, wait
			till he/she is done before clicking.
		</p>

		<p>
			Finally the "Clear Victories" button resets the victory for both players
			to 0, and stops the winner animation.
		</p>

		<h1 id="binary_frame_format">Binary frame format</h1>

		<p>
			All captured frames are sent in binary and weight 568 bits (71 bytes) per
			frame. On a capture setup of 60fps, the game stream requirements are
			therefore 71*60 = 4,260 B/s (~4KB/s).
		</p>

		<p>They have the format below.</p>

		<p>
			Game fields may be null (like das trainer's instant das when sending
			classic frames), in which case the field's bits should all be set to 1.
		</p>

		<h1>Ideas for improvements</h1>

		<p>
			As with any software, there's always more... "More, more, more, more,
			more" as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Neubauer">the GOAT</a> would have said.
		</p>

		<p>
			The list of TODO items is tracked as
			<a href="https://github.com/timotheeg/nestrischamps/issues"
				>issues in the github project</a
			>. Feel free to open feature requests and bug reports there. There's no
			ETA and guarantee on when anything might get done though, so patience is
			key :).
